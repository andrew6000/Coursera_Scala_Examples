/** Class Hierarchy: Simulation > Gates (Wire, AND, OR, NOT) >
 *  Circuits (HalfAdder, FullAdder) > MySimulation and Param trait.
  *
  *  A simple API for discrete event simulation of Digital Circuits
  *
  *  Structure a system into layers, in which the layers are
  *  a domain specific language.
  *
  * The class wire and the functions inverter, AND gate, and OR gate,
  * represent a small description language for digital circuits.
  *
  * Wires transport signals that are transformed by components.

We represent signals using booleans true and false.

The base components (gates) are:
	- The Inverter, whose output is the inverse of its input.
	- The AND Gate, whose output is the conjunction of its inputs.
	- The OR Gate, whose output is the disjunction of its inputs

Other components can be constructed by combining these base
components.

The components have a reaction time (or delay), i.e. their outputs
donâ€™t change immediately after a change to their inputs.
