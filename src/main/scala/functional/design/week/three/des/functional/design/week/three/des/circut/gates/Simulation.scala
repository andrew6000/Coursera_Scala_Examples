/** Class Hierarchy: Simulation > Gates (Wire, AND, OR, NOT) >

  *
  *  A simple API for discrete event simulation of Digital Circuits
  *
  *  Structure a system into layers, in which the layers are
  *  a domain specific language.
  *
  * The class wire and the functions inverter, AND gate, and OR gate,
  * represent a small description language for digital circuits.
  *
  * Wires transport signals that are transformed by components.

We represent signals using booleans true and false.

The base components (gates) are:
	- The Inverter, whose output is the inverse of its input.
	- The AND Gate, whose output is the conjunction of its inputs.
	- The OR Gate, whose output is the disjunction of its inputs

Other components can be constructed by combining these base
components.

The components have a reaction time (or delay), i.e. their outputs
donâ€™t change immediately after a change to their inputs.

/*
* SUMMARY
*
* It's seen that adding state and assignments makes our mental model of computation
* more complicated.
*
* In particular, we lose the property of referential transparency,
* which says that it doesn't matter whether we use a name or the thing it refers to.
*
* The other thing that we lose is the substitution model so we do not have any more
* an easy way to trace computations by rewriting.
*
* On the other hand, assignments allow us to formulate some programs in an
* elegant and concise way.
*
* We've seen that with the example of discreet event simulation where a system is
* represented by a list of action and that list was a neutral variable, it changed
* during the time of simulations.
*
* The effect of the actions when they're called would, in turn, change the state of objects.
* And they could also install other actions to be executed in the future.
*
* You've seen that in this way, combining higher functions and assignments in state led to some very,
  very powerful techniques that let you express fundamentally complex computations in a concise and understandable way.

  In the end, it's a trade-off. You get more expressiveness that helps you tackle certain problems in a simpler way.

  But on the other hand, you lose tools for reasoning about your program preferential transparency into substitution model.

  So, I guess the moral would be that you should stick to the purely function model whenever you can.

  And you should use state responsibly when you must.
